# Introduction  

As a **Data Science major** at Northern Arizona University (graduating May 2026) with dual minors in **Mathematics and Statistics**, I am passionate about using data to uncover patterns, generate insights, and solve real-world problems.  

My technical foundation includes programming languages such as **Python, R, SQL, Java, and C**, complemented by experience with **SAP Analytics Cloud, Excel, QuickBooks, and Microsoft Office**. Beyond academics, I have applied these skills in both **research**, developing deep learning models to analyze volcanic landforms through the NASA Space Grant Research Program, and in **industry**, streamlining financial data workflows and eliminating $162.5M in obsolete records during my internship with the City of Phoenix ERP Division.  

Looking ahead, I aim to apply data science to drive positive impact in public and private sector industries, leveraging analytics to inform decisions, improve systems, and support communities through evidence-based strategies.
