# Introduction  

As a **Data Science major** at Northern Arizona University (graduating May 2026) with dual minors in **Mathematics and Statistics**, I am passionate about using data to uncover patterns, generate insights, and solve real-world problems.  

My technical foundation includes programming languages such as **Python, R, SQL, Java, and C**, complemented by experience with **SAP Analytics Cloud, Excel, QuickBooks, and Microsoft Office**. Beyond academics, I have applied these skills in both research, developing deep learning models to analyze volcanic landforms through the NASA Space Grant Research Program, and in industry, streamlining financial data workflows and eliminating $162.5M in obsolete records during my internship with the City of Phoenix ERP Division.  

Looking ahead, I aim to apply data science to drive positive impact in public and private sector industries, leveraging analytics to inform decisions, improve systems, and support communities through evidence-based strategies.

# Projects  

### Automated Volcanic Field DEM Analysis (NASA Space Grant Project)
**[GitHub Link](https://github.com/aschrameck/Volcanic-DEM-Analysis)**  
- Developing a Python function to extract the DEM of a volcanic cone using radial slope sampling and adaptive edge detection, outputting crater and base boundary polygons and a segmented raster.
- Writing a function to automate extracting measurements such as ellipticity, elongation, isoperimetric circularity, and basal area.
- Plan to perform cluster analysis in R to classify landform types and identify patterns in morphological features.
- Tools: Python (DEM processing, function automation), R (cluster analysis, statistical modeling, data visualization).

### aksStat R Package
**[GitHub Link](https://github.com/aschrameck/aksStat)**  
- Developed an R package for statistical simulations, including random number generation, MCMC sampling, subset cross-validation, and Gelman diagnostics.
- Implemented core functions: accept_reject_rn(), inverse.cdf.rn(), mcmc_sampling(), gelman_diag(), subset.cross.validation(), and tune.k().
- Authored comprehensive documentation with usage examples to facilitate reproducibility and ease of use.
- Tools: R (package development, statistical modeling, function testing, documentation).

### Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) Evaluation  
**[GitHub Link](https://github.com/aschrameck/DASS)**  
- Analyzed survey responses from ~40,000 participants to assess response accuracy and reliability.  
- Preprocessed data by isolating illness-specific questions and excluding non-diagnostic cases.  
- Built visualizations to reveal mental health condition patterns.  
- Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

### World Happiness Score Analysis  
**[GitHub Link](https://github.com/aschrameck/World-Happiness-Scores)**  
- Analyzed Gallup World Poll data for 150+ countries, exploring links between happiness, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.  
- Discovered strong positive correlations among happiness, wealth, and health metrics.  
- Developed visualizations to illustrate global trends and insights.  
- Tools: R (data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization)

### Currency Converter  
**[GitHub Link](https://github.com/aschrameck/Currency-Converter)**  
- Collaborated on a Java-based currency converter with real-time exchange calculations.  
- Designed and implemented a GUI for user-friendly interactions.  
- Ensured robust exception handling and accuracy through comprehensive testing.  
- Tools: Java (GUI development, backend logic)
